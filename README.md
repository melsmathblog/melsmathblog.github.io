# Hello!
Hello! My name is Mealaud Mokhtarzad and I'm a pure math major at UCLA (class of '23). On this blog I aim to showcase math stuff that I find cool along with the notes I write for my classes (which I do use Atom and Inkscape). I have taken inspiration from [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/) in regards to notetaking (using Inkscape, for example), but I may do a post about how exactly I take notes eventually.
