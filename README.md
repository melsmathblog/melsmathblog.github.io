# Hello!
Hello! My name is Mealaud "Mel" Mokhtarzad and I'm a pure math major at UCLA (class of '23). On this blog I aim to showcase math stuff that I find cool along with the notes I write for my classes (which I use Atom and Inkscape for). I have taken inspiration from [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/) in regards to notetaking (using Inkscape, for example), but I may do a post about how exactly I take notes eventually.

# Class notes
Sadly (though it worked fine for my most of my college career so far haha), I don't have notes for the first year of courses I took at UCLA, but I have notes starting fall of 2020, so our list will begin there. Before I list them, I'd like to remark that the notes I write are a mix between lecture notes and my own exposition on the topic. Hopefully it's helpful to you if you decide to reference or use them.
